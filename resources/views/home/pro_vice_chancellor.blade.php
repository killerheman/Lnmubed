            <p>I congratulate the B.Ed. (regular) Department running under Directorate of Distance Education, Lalit Narayan Mithila University, Darbhanga for publishing a prospectus on the occasion of tenth year of its establishment.</p>
            <p>
                Teacher education institutions are contributing hugely to the society by educating the future teachers who would be mentoring the future generation. My concept of a teacher is a person who not only trains and skills the students to acquire the knowledge of the subject but also believes in his / her taught, helps them to dream, supports and pushes them to achieve their goals; sometimes acting as a bridge to assist them in crossing difficult terrains and also strengthen them to face the real world so that they do not break down in failure. Thus a transformed youth takes shape who is a strong personality full of knowledge and skill of the subject along with vigour and compassion and able to contribute towards the development of the family, the society, the nation and the human race; also takes care of the planet EARTH with all its living entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teacher education institutions thus shoulder a huge responsibility. With the fast growth of technology assisted Teaching-Learning-Evaluation (TLE) and involvement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, I am confident that the B Ed (regular) Department now established firmly on the platform of its last ten years of experience and good work would provide the best capacity building opportunity to its students. I believe that the new prospectus will incorporate the requirements of the changing scenario in TLE and recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                I extend my greetings to the Director, Head of the Department, members of management committee, teachers, staff members and students on this special occasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                My best wishes for all future endeavor.
            </p>
